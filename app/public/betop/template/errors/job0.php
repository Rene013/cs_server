                    <p>We partner with UKSBS Shared Business Services to run our recruitment.</p>
					<p>When you click on any of the roles below (or the 'Search our vacancies' button), you will be transferred to their TopCareer.jobs website. Here you will be able to filter your search for STFC jobs, submit a CV and covering letter and track the progress of your application. UKSBS will contact you with the result of any job applications you submit. If you are invited to interview they will advise you about the arrangements.</p>
					<p>Here at STFC, we are also involved with you right from the start. Our vacancies give you contact details for the manager recruiting for the job.</p>
					<p>Our managers shortlist applications, run the interviews and offer the jobs. Our own HR team and site-based staff will look after you on the day of your interview.</p>
					<p>STFC also has a Talent Pool, where you can lodge your details speculatively. Our managers search the Talent Pool as soon as they have a vacancy, so if something comes up that you are a match for they’ll invite you for interview. You can submit your CV to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:talentpool@stfc.ac.uk">talentpool@stfc.ac.uk</a></p>
