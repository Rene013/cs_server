			The most interesting one is the market studies branch!
			Market studies branch is our point of depart, it is likely important to know what is going on market than go to the market to be a provider of what marketers needs,
			our point of depart in this quest is what is really important for the market owner and the market bedder? Our market are for selling and you are here to buy
			we show our products and you buy our products because they are sufficient to what you need, we don't excite your point of what you need to make you hangry of our products, 
			we just tells you now here is what you will use to get to this point because we see what is on market and we learned the market products ahead. If you are interested to see what 
			we have to offer, please tell us more by email and get in touch with our products service manager.

			In BeTop, we are scientists first, we put knowledge on the first stage of our work. We have invested our serves in four branches of researches: 
			The first branch is for Computational research, we are interested in calculations. Our branch of computational science is interested in developing advanced methods of 
			superposition functional analysis computation to study several key issues of the economy, social demographic and political related issues for current society,
			we integrate in this program the development of next generation scientific issues like biophysical and astro-biological research. Our team have a particular 
			interest to study condensed matter physical environment. We have learned since our beginning that we all are composed by some matter compounds materials, but how
			do they have come to desegregate in this material behavioural to be this kins we are all able to take profit and consume them as guaranteed? do we realy thinks 
			that material are consumable? do we think of the future? what is going to happen for the next coming generations? Are they going to enjoy what we had and took as 
			a guaranteed material?
			When ask my self this question I just feel frustrated to be in this world, the future depends on us if we don't fight for it we will never get anywhere and
			our next generations will really suffer from our doing!!! We don't want that to happen which reason why, I have thought to make this a deal of my fight and 
			my being quest. We have to build the future, we never had the chance but lets give a chance to our future generation.
			The research in betop focuses on Computation physics, biophysics and astrobiology, Device desing and integration and simulation.
